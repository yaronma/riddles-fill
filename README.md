# Matrix Filling Algorithm
The Problem: Fill a square matrix of size 2^n with L-shaped tiles

## Description
Given a matrix of size 2^n (where n is natural number; n = (1, 2, 3, 4, ...}) and a single colored cell, you have to fill it with L-shaped tiles. The tiles should not overlapp each other or extend from the boundaries of the matrix.
